Subject: Request for Rescheduling / Virtual Interview

Dear [Manager’s Name / HR Team / Interviewer’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to inform you that my grandmother passed away today at around 1:30 PM. Due to this unfortunate family emergency, I will not be available to attend office or interviews for the coming week.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If possible, I kindly request that the interview be scheduled as a virtual interview on Tuesday, at a time convenient to you.

Thank you very much for your understanding and support during this difficult time. I truly appreciate your consideration.

Warm regards,
